Miss Bradley is a 24 year old white female US citizen. She was         traveling with her parents and was last seen in their stateroom at     5:15 a.m. on March 24, 1998 as the vessel was maneuvering into the     port of Curacao.

However, no evidence of GAM involvement has been presented and it would be atypical for them so far offshore.  Although no source has mentioned the possibility, the incident could be the result of Indonesia's enforcement of its ban on passage of vessels near Aceh waters ""without proper permits"".

An IMB special alert dated 20 Dec reports the tanker lost contact with their vessel as of 19 Dec.  The tanker departed Palembang, Indonesia for Singapore on 18 Dec laden with 16,585 MT of vegetable oil.  Vessels last known location reported by the owner was 02-20N  106-41E at 0530 UTC, on 19 Dec.  ONI Comment:  In April of this year, pirates boarded a general cargo ship laden with tin ingot in Indonesian waters, forced the crew to take the vessel to a port in Malaysia and offload the cargo, before returning to Indonesian waters and releasing the vessel and crew unharmed.  The cargo was later found intact by Malaysian authorities in the same location it was offloaded.  In July, pirates boarded a tug and barge while awaiting berth in a port in Malaysia and siphoned approximately 3,500 MT of crude palm oil, into another product  tanker.  The Malaysian Marine Police found the product tanker and arrested the crew, while the Indonesian Navy Pursuit Team arrested five individuals believed to have perpetrated the theft.  In September, a general cargo vessel laden with 660 tons of tin ingot  was boarded by pirates, while underway off Indonesia.  The 14 crewmembers were set adrift in a fishing boat and landed safely on land.  The vessel was later discovered sunk not far from where it was hijacked and salvage divers assessed the cargo to be intact.   These incidents appear to represent a form of piracy not reported since Chinas crackdown on black-market activity starting in 1998, wherein a ship is targeted for seizure at its load port and the cargo is taken to some destination, where arrangements for disposal  have already been concluded.  The complexity of the operation suggests transnational players at the ship selection and cargo-disposal ends of the operation.  In these types of cases, crew and ship owner complicity must be considered, since they have no  immediate financial interest in the cargo, per se.  Since the crackdown on the illegal Chinese markets, hijackers have experienced difficulty disposing of their cargos.  If the STEADFAST is indeed hijacked and is not rapidly located and its cargo recovered, or  traced, this could be a sign that criminal gangs have solved their problem with disposal of stolen goods (IMB, ONI)",1,5,XI

Two suspicious boats were observed ahead of the vessel. The boats crossed the vessels bow and then turned back. A third boat was later seen coming from the port side which later rendezvoused with one of the original boats. The vessel made a sharp course alteration to the starboard side. One boat altered its course to parallel with the vessel, about 50 meters away. This boat had three men onboard; one man was seen to be using a cell phone or similar device. The individual using the device was standing up in the bows of the boat and appeared to be reporting details about the vessel to someone. After a few minutes the boat altered its course and crossed the vessels stern. All three boats were last seen heading north. Each boat was 10M in length, two had a white hull and one had a grayish hull, all having a large outboard motor. Each boat carried 3-4 men and were all dressed in white t-shirts and shorts. No sign of any weapons but the closest boat was seen to have a small hold type space with hatch removed. There was no sign of any fishing gear.  Security message was broadcasted to all ships via VHF chn. 16. Details of crafts and position given. UKMTO COMMENT: UKMTO called the vessel and discussed the incident at length with the master. The position of the vessel at the time of the boat activity was well north of any reported attack but was only 23NM off the Yemen coast in known fishing grounds. The master felt the vessels were not fishing because he judged them by European fishing habits rather than the local fishing techniques where the fisherman lay nets first then try to coral the fish (generally Tuna in this fashion) towards the nets. The item of note in the report though is the mobile phone. If the phone was analogue then it may be possible to get a signal to phone (and this may explain the man standing up in the bow whilst he tried to get higher for a signal) but it would still be extreme range. GSM phones would not have that range normally without refraction. The other alternative is a Thuraya sat phone or the like. This would be a very expensive luxury for a local fisherman so could suggest a spotting network for pirates. UKMTO are keeping an open mind on the incident and will watch for further trends (Operator, UKMTO).",1,9,VIII

Chinese fishermen are accused of attacking the coast  guard officer as he tried to board the Chinese vessel.  They hit him with a shovel and wooden stick and threw him into the sea, where he drowned.  The fishermen also used shovels and steel pipes to fight 17 other officers, injuring six of them.  Korean Coast Guard officials said yesterday that they have arrested 11 Chinese fishermen allegedly involved in the murder.  According to the Coast Guard, a patrol ship found the 17-ton Chinese fishing boat and ordered the crew to turn off the engine. Several officers boarded the fishing boat for an inspection.  The vessel was seized 62 miles northwest of the incident.  The deceased coast guardsman was found six kilometers south  of the scene, several hours after he was thrown overboard.  Coast Guard officials said that the unlicensed Chinese fishermen illegally entered Korea's exclusive economic zone. Unlicensed Chinese fishermen fiercely resist arrest because illegal boat owners operating without permission face fines up to tens of millions of won.
